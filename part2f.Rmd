This program is part of a series of R programs for the Introduction to R class. This program shows you how to create new categorical variables.

```{r r-version-and-current-date}
R.version.string
Sys.Date()
```

Let's erase any stray data and load the data from part 2e.

```{r read-part-2e-data}
rm(list=ls())
load(file="part2e.RData")
```

There are several ways to create a new categorical variable in R, but the easiest way is through the use of logical comparisons.

Suppose you wanted to compute a categorical variable called "child" which is equal to 1 if a passenger is less than 18 years old and 0 if a passenger is 18 or older. Here's one way to do it.

```{r recode-simple}
ti$child <- as.numeric(ti$Age<18)
```

Anytime you create a new categorical variable, you should run a crosstabulation to check your results. Pay special attention to how missing values are handled. I'm only printing out the head and the tail to save space, but you should look at the entire table.

```{r recode-check}
chk <- table(ti$Age,ti$child,useNA="always")
head(chk)
tail(chk)
```

Note that since age has lots of values, we prefer to use that as the rows in the crosstabulation.

## On your own

Redfine a child as anyone under 21 years of age. Use the factor function to create labels of "adult" for 0 and "child" for 1. Are children more likely to survive than adults?

## More on recoding

Sometimes you want to combine two or more of the categories together. Here is how you might create a new passenger class variable with values of 1 for second and third class and 0 for first class.

The vertical bar (|) is the R symobl for logical OR.

As before, it's a good a idea to run a crosstabulation to verify that the new coding was done properly.

```{r recode-combine}
ti$lower.class <- as.numeric(ti$PClass=="2nd" | ti$PClass=="3rd")
table(ti$PClass,ti$lower.class)
ti$lower.class.factor <- factor(ti$lower.class, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("No", "Yes"))
```

## Creating multi-level categories

You can create multi-level categories using a complex logic system, but you can do it simpler and faster with the cut function.

```{r recode-cut}
ti$age.groups <- cut(ti$Age,breaks=c(0,2,6,9,12,19,99))
table(ti$age.groups,useNA="always")
table(ti$Age, ti$age.groups, useNA="always")
```

The notation used by cut may be familiar to mathematicians who know the difference between open and closed sets, but you can choose different labels.

```{r recode-cut-label}
lb <- c("Infant","Toddler","Child","Tween","Teenager","Adult")
ti$age.groups <- cut(ti$Age,breaks=c(0,2,6,9,12,19,99),labels=lb)
table(ti$age.groups,useNA="always")
lb <- c("Infant (up to 2 yrs)","Toddler (3 to 6 yrs)","Child (7 to 9 yrs)","Tween (10 to 12 yrs)","Teenager (13 to 19 yrs)","Adult (20 yrs and older")
```

## On your own

Create a new variable which is 1 for senior citizens (65 yrs and older), 0 for younger than that age, and NA if the age is unknown.

save.image("part2f.RData")
